## Syfte och mål

Förstå följande

- Metoden Lean Startup
- Hur L.S kan kopplas till produktutveckling (Fysiska eller digitala produkter)

## What is Lean Startup?

Hur man startar upp en egen verksamhet.

### Lean Startup Historia

Eric Ries
Stor betydelse i Silicon Valley som blivit mer tillämpat över hela världen.
W. Edwards Deming (looked at ford who created cars faster in stages)

"The customer is the most important part of the production line"

- W. Edwards Deming

The customer is the reason to why the production is in place, if the customer doesn't want it then there's no reason to produce.

### Definitioner

Startup är inte samma sak som en enterprise.

Startup jobbar i det okända, en idé som man inte vet är värt att skapa affärer runt om.
Går det att driva denna idé och bekosta detta?
Exempel, bilar är en produkt som människor är redo att lägga pengar på.

"A human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty."

- Eric Ries

#### Path to success

People think success looks like a straight line towards their goal. The path is linear.

In reality it's all just a tangled mess.

Människan har lite svårt att förstå sig på och planera sitt mål i exempelvis startups.

#### Common Startup mistakes

1. Building something nobody wants!
2. Hiring Poorly
3. Lack of focus
4. Fail to execute Sales & Marketing
5. Not Having The Right Co-Founders
6. Chasing investors, not customers
7. Not Making Sure you have enough money

- Lägger ner tid och resurser på fel saker. Svårt att veta vart man ska börja eller vart man ska ta vägen.
- Oproduktiva möten, bättre att göra något eller testa något mot en marknad.
- Olika typer av kompetenser och bakgrunder och idéer som gör att man förstår inte riktigt varandra.

Hamnar i en s.k. death valley.
Man har inget som man kan presentera eller få någon annan med på.

"We need a better approach for creating value for customer & lowering risk of failure".

Lean Startup is this approach.

### The different parts

Business Model
Design with testing
Value Proposition
Value of the product

### How to think when developing a product or service

1. Identify the "right product to build"
2. Build "the right product" correctly with "the right methods"
3. Observe the customer by observing their behavior.

This might be an example of how the old marketing would look like.
Early days you weren't in need of a cellphone. However they had to push this into the marketplace and create the interest.

If you have enough money then you can probably create a product not existing before and force it into the marketplace.

Let an app be free, if they download the application that's the start.
Example: Creating level 1 of a game, see if anybody plays the first level.
If nobody plays it then why create the following levels?

"A method to systematically address uncertainty through rapid iteration and market learning."

ChatGPT says:

Recieve knowledge on what the marketplace wants through these rapid iterations.

"Lean Startup" is an approach for launching businesses and products, that relies on validated learning, scientific experimentation.

Learning with each release.

Lean Startup helps us respond to these very important questions:

1. Should we build this new product or service?
2. How can we increase our odds of success?

### How it starts

It all starts with a vision.

Let's say the cookie monster is our customer.

He has a need. What is that need?

He wants to eat something, so let's explore the idea of fruits.

The cookie monster doesn't want this. They really want cookies. That's an example of missing the customers needs and wants. But with your own opinion fruits might be perfect for you.

## Uncertainty

### The different types of uncertainties

- Technical/product risk
Can we build this?

- Customer/market risk
If we build this, will people use/buy it?

- Business model risk
Once we build this, can we find a way to make money from it?

Example: Testing through science experiment if there's an interest in the market. An american city, see if there's an interest of McDonalds selling spaghetti.

Set up the spaghetti on the menu, see if people wants it by asking for it.
In this particular example none asked for it. Hence proving that this is something that the customer in just that particular market wouldn't be interested in.

Decice early on, what is an success for us?
When should you continue, when should you stop?

s true after testing, then you know to proceed, if not, then scrap that. It's basically setting up an hypothesis.

## Assumptions

### What is an assumption

Starts with "I believe that" statements.
"If ten people wants to buy spaghetti for a week"
How much would that then be in a bigger scale?

Clarifies your current understanding of what you don't know with certainty.

Some assumptions are more important than others. Identify and isolate critical assumptions.

### An example: How AirBNB started

AIRBMB Early Assumption:

"In a city where space is extremely limited, people will pay a small amount of money, for a small amount of space... they don't need a hotel."

They **make** a simple website (a blog with maps).
2 men, 1 woman **showed up**, paying $80 each.
After guests left they thought this could be a big **idea**.
They invited former roommate as a **co-founder** to build the site.
**Launched** at SXSW - got two bookings.
"Brian, I hope it's not the only idea you are writing on".

### How to get into trouble

Go off assuming that you know things that you actually don't know.

### Exercise 1

Assumptions

1. Think of a new product or service
Öl med ölkorvsmak
"Både öl och korv! Varför tugga när du kan dricka?"
Mobil diskservice
"Vi kommer hem och diskar hos dig! Snabbt, enkelt och rent!"

2. Write a list of assumptions

How to prioritize assumptions

1. Identify your most important assumptions using a simple prioritization

## Hypotheses

### What is an hypothesis

- "If then" statement that helps design tests for an assumption.
- Clarifies your current understanding of what uncertainty you seek to resolve.
- Is specific in the action, timing and value/amount of impact.
- Helps to design and build an MVP.

### Exercise 2

1. For your most important assumption, write some hypotheses you might want to test?

## Validated Learning

## Experiements

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

### What is Minimum Viable Product?

- Experiment that helps you validate (or invalidate) hypotheses about the value or growth potential for a new product
- An MVP helps you answer a specific question about one of your assumptions.
- Building an MVP **is not a 1-time event**.

Have a little bit of all, not just one thing.

The pyramid looks like:

- Design
- UX
- Usable
- Reliable
- Functional

A slice of the whole cake.

### Minimum != Shitty Product

"The MVP is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort.""

- Eric Ries

Just because something fails doesn't mean you didn't learn anything.

### Minimum Viable Experiment

You can learn without building an MVP!

- Customer interviews (e.q. Lean Startup Machine)
- Landing page test
See how many people are interested in it by just creating the idea that it exists.
- Undercover competitor studies
- Concierge Test / Wizard of Oz Prototyping
- Prototypes
- A/B Tests
Makes two versions of a thing to see what is most used or most interesting.

For the key assumption/hypothesis, design the most simple MVP you can think.

"Perfection is not when there is nothing left to add but nothing left to take away".

### What is Valiedated Learning

Translate your critical assumptions into an experiment.

1. Isolate critical assumptions for testing.
2. Draft your hypothesis to be tested.
3. Build an experiment.
4. Measure the results.
5. Collect the data and learning in a systematic way.

Build the product to measure, then take that data to learn and turn that into ideas that you can keep building.

"Everything is an assumption"
"Build to measure"
"Measure to learn"

Pivot or Iterate?
Should I keep developing this idea or should I let go of it or turn a different direction.

## Customer Development

## Pivots

Types of Pivots

1. Zoom-in pivot
2. Zoom-out pivot
3. Customer segment pivot
4. Customer need pivot
5. Platform pivot
6. Business architecture pivot
7. Value capture pivot
8. Engine of growth pivot
9. Channel Pivot
10. Technology Pivot
