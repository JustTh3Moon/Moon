        <h2>Want to hear about a random fact about otters? </h2>
        <h3>No? Yes? Either way, here we go!</h3>
        <p>Don't challenge otters to a breath holding competition. An otter's lung capacity is 2.5 times greater than that of similar-sized land mammals. Sea otters have been known to stay submerged for more than 5 minutes at a time. River otters, however, can hold their breath for up to 8 minutes. The increased time underwater improves otters' opportunity to sense prey and forage for food.</p>

        <h2>Here's another fact that I really like about otters!</h2>
        <h3>Sea otters hold hands when they sleep</h3>
        <p>Occasionally, sea otters sleep on the water by floating on their backs. To avoid floating away in the vast seas, they hold each other's front paws as they sleep. Although they don't always partake in this behavior, this is one of the most well-known and adorable otter facts out there.</p>
